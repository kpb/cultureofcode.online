Your web page has a header, some content, and a footer. If the content isn't vertically long enough to push the footer
down, the footer ends up in the middle of the page - ugly!<!--more--> A lot of solutions use a fixed height footer, which is great
until you load the page in a phone or a tablet.


I found a [simple solution](http://galengidman.com/2014/03/25/responsive-flexible-height-sticky-footers-in-css/), and
integrated it with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).


If you need a responsive, flexible-height, sticky footer - check out my [sticky-footer GitHub
project](https://github.com/kpb/sticky-footer).
