I see so many integration tests that test something, but just what is hard to tell. And worse, when they fail, they
don't help determine what exactly went wrong.

### Project ###

[Spring RestDocs](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs) with the
[Spring Auto Restdocs](https://github.com/ScaCap/spring-auto-restdocs) extension


Documentation is hard. The least you can do is document your public API. This project makes documenting a [Spring
Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) microservice a snap. Vanilla Spring Restdocs was a verbose way of creating
documentation. The extension uses your javadoc to create the documentation, helping you stay DRY. I'll have a tutorial
on this soon.

Platform](https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/the-upside-down-economics-of-building-your-own-platform)

Write your own framework. Make your own cache. Do it ourselves, what could go wrong? How about everything!

### Book ###

### Beer ###

[Ska Modus Mandrina IPA](http://skabrewing.com/brews/modus-mandarina-ipa/)

Because, after looking at code all day, you could use a cold brew.  Not-too-fruity orange ipa with Mandarina Bavaria
hops. This one's for the summer.

That's the Rundown. Let me know if you found any of this interesting.
