description: COVID-19 got you working from home? A Collection of tips and resources.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us are lucky enough to be able to work from home. The good news is, for high
performance companies and teams, this is nothing new. There are examples of happy, high performance teams that have
embraced distributed work. Some of them have been working this way for more than 20 years and have documented
their tools, practices, and techniques.

I'm hearing a lot of negative talk, mostly from management inexperienced with distributed work, assuming a reduction in
productivity. Of course anything new or stressful will reduce productivity for a short while. But, it might be more
helpful to embrace these good practices and tools to establish a culture of distributed 'remote first' working that will
serve you, your teams, and your company long after the pandemic has slowed down. If being forced to work remotely is
disruptive, take the chance to fundamentally improve the way you work.

### Terminology

I'm preferring the term _distributed_ vice _remote_, _work-from-home_, or _telecommute_ intentionally. Distributed
connotes an all-in, remote-first philosophy and an all-employee inclusiveness, as opposed to a we're here in the real
office and you're over there pretending to work in your pajamas.

There are good reasons to establish a distributed work culture beyond slowing the spread of a virus.

- It will amplify ineffective communication and force you to improve how you communicate as a company/team.
- You can hire the best people, wherever they are.
- You will spend less time commuting and can use that time for work and/or not burning out.
- For development teams, it will require you to look at your tools and processes and you'll likely find those that
  support distributed work have lots of other advantages. (Using a sane [pull-request/code
  review][github-pull-request] process, for example.)

### Practices

#### Presence

Don't fall for the trap of asking people for twice daily statuses by phone or email; if you weren't doing that in an office it doesn't
make sense to do it now.

> Motivated people do not need to be monitored. In fact, a culture of monitoring will turn motivated people into
  unmotivated people. If you don't have motivated people, look at your management culture. -- Allen Holub

Do continue whatever it was you were doing before: Daily stand-ups, Scrums, etc.

#### Company Support

The best tools are remarkably inexpensive. Collaboration tools like [Slack][slack], [Zoom][zoom], [Basecamp][basecamp],
and a [good headset][sennheiser-sc30] can make a huge difference when everyone is distributed. All of this is cheaper
than the overhead of poor communication.

#### Meetings

No matter where you are sitting, everyone is remote. That means that everyone connects to the meeting from their
pc. From the Alyssa Mazzina article below:

> If you’re at a desk in the office, that’s where you take your meetings, and if your desk is at home, you do it
there. We get so used to this practice that sometimes people within the same office will jump in a Hangout. On a recent
visit to the New York office, I was amused to see two of my coworkers sitting at cubicles across from each
other... having a conversation via video chat.

> It seems ridiculous at first, but there’s a reason for it. If we’re all taking meetings via Hangouts, we’re all on
equal footing. If I’d needed to join that two-person conversation from across the country, I could have, with no
issue. In larger meetings, it means no side conversations are happening at the table that the remotes don’t get to be
part of. When I’m in a meeting at home, I don’t always know who’s in an office and who’s not. Everybody’s at a desk with
a headset “remoting” in to Google Hangouts.

> Remote-first means when somebody wants to present something, they’re not going to stand up at a whiteboard and write
while the remotes squint at their screens trying to see it. We present electronically. It means when somebody refers to
a document, they’re not pulling it out of a file folder and passing it around the table, leaving the remotes out of the
loop

In my experience, video is important. But, audio quality is even more important. Get a headset. I have a [Sennheiser
headset][sennheiser-sc30], but there are lots of affordable options. I've heard of people having good luck using podcast
microphones, but I've never tried it.

Use video if at all possible - so much of our communication is non-verbal.

#### Kindness

Getting sent home to work remotely would be stressful enough. Being forced into it overnight due to global health crisis
is a really big deal that is going to make a lot of us understandably anxious. Alice Goldfuss wrote an [insightful
article][remote-work-in-the-time-of-covid19] full of both great tips on distributed working, but also some supportive
advice an coping with this drastic, overnight change.

I hope you can find something helpful in these references.
