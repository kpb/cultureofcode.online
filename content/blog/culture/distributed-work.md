description: COVID-19 got you working from home? A Collection of tips and resources.

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, a lot of us are lucky enough to be able to work from home. While it's great we
don't have to worry about losing our income in the short term, being forced into working from home by a global pandemic
is stressful and likely to impact our team/org/company productivity.<!--more--> There are plenty of examples of high
performance companies and teams that have embraced distributed work long before they were forced to. Some of them have
been working this way for more than 20 years and have documented their tools, practices, and techniques. Let's learn
from them.

I hear a lot of negative talk about how unproductive we will be, mostly from management inexperienced with distributed
work. Of course anything new or stressful will reduce productivity for a short while. But, it might be more helpful to
embrace good practices and tools towards establishing a culture of distributed 'remote-first' working that will serve
you, your teams, and your company long after the pandemic has slowed down. If being forced to work remotely is going to
be disruptive, take this opportunity to fundamentally improve the way we work.

### Terminology

I'm intentionally preferring the term _distributed_ versus _remote_, _work-from-home_, or _telecommute_. Distributed
connotes an all-in, remote-first philosophy; an every-employee inclusiveness, as opposed to a we're here in the real
office and you're over there pretending to work from home in your pajamas.

### Practices

#### Presence

Don't fall for the trap of asking people for twice daily statuses by phone or email; if you weren't doing that in an office it doesn't
make sense to do it now.

> Motivated people do not need to be monitored. In fact, a culture of monitoring will turn motivated people into
  unmotivated people. If you don't have motivated people, look at your management culture. -- [Allen Holub][allen-holub]

Do continue whatever it was you were doing before: Daily stand-ups, Scrums, etc. Watch the progress of _what_ needs to get
done, not exactly _what time_ it's being worked on.

#### Company Support

The best tools are remarkably inexpensive. Collaboration tools like [Slack][slack], [Zoom][zoom], [Basecamp][basecamp],
and a [good headset][sennheiser-sc30] can make a huge difference when everyone is distributed. All of this is cheaper
than the overhead of poor communication. Are your network and VPN robust enough to support this surge in use? Do
employees need anything at home such as monitors, ergonmic workstations, desk lamps, etc.?

#### Meetings

No matter where you are sitting, everyone is remote. That means that everyone connects to the meeting from their
pc. From the Alyssa Mazzina article below:

> If you’re at a desk in the office, that’s where you take your meetings, and if your desk is at home, you do it
there. We get so used to this practice that sometimes people within the same office will jump in a Hangout. On a recent
visit to the New York office, I was amused to see two of my coworkers sitting at cubicles across from each
other... having a conversation via video chat.

> It seems ridiculous at first, but there’s a reason for it. If we’re all taking meetings via Hangouts, we’re all on
equal footing. If I’d needed to join that two-person conversation from across the country, I could have, with no
issue. In larger meetings, it means no side conversations are happening at the table that the remotes don’t get to be
part of. When I’m in a meeting at home, I don’t always know who’s in an office and who’s not. Everybody’s at a desk with
a headset “remoting” in to Google Hangouts.

> Remote-first means when somebody wants to present something, they’re not going to stand up at a whiteboard and write
while the remotes squint at their screens trying to see it. We present electronically. It means when somebody refers to
a document, they’re not pulling it out of a file folder and passing it around the table, leaving the remotes out of the
loop

In my experience, video is important. But, audio quality is even more important. Get a headset. I have a [Sennheiser
headset][sennheiser-sc30], but there are [lots of affordable options][dont-mute-get-a-better-headset]. I've heard of
people having good luck using podcast microphones, but I've never tried it.

Use video if at all possible - so much of our communication is non-verbal.

#### Kindness

Getting sent home to work remotely without any prior planning would be stressful. Being forced into it overnight due to
global health crisis is a really big deal that is going to make a lot of us understandably anxious. Alice Goldfuss wrote
an [insightful article][remote-work-in-the-time-of-covid19] full of both great tips on distributed working and
supportive advice on coping with this drastic, overnight change.
