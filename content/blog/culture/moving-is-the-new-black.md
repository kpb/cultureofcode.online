But, what can a computer using, knowledge worker thug do? I need to be in front of a screen all day (and more). Enter the standing desk.


Some workplaces will provide one for you. Some might require a note from your doctor.


You could _buy_ a standing desk.  [StandDesk](https://www.standdesk.co/) has a bunch of stylish ones that include a
motor for raising/lowering the desk. Check out the standing steez on this content creator - gettin' healthy, reping New
Balance shoes, and sipping wine in his fine crib.

[Colin Nederkoorn](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/) wrote a great article: [A Standing Desk for
$22](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html). So, if you're on a budget, or work at a
company that would rather you die in your chair than live on your feet, check out how easy and cheap it is to build a
standing desk from [Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/) parts. I got everything for $40 including shipping to my front door,
since shipping was cheaper than the gas and I'm not hungry for [horse
meatballs](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/europe/ikea-recalls-its-meatballs-horse-meat-is-detected.html).


Quit being a slave to the chair that is trying to kill you. Get out your seat and [jump around](https://youtu.be/XhzpxjuwZy0).
