> "...in a world increasingly dominated by image culture (TV, movies, .jpg files), UNIX remains rooted in the culture of
  the word."

A classic essay by Thomas Scoville. [The Elements of Style: UNIX as Literature](http://theody.net/elements.html)

Text is still the killer app.

Also, read all about the [history of UNIX](https://unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html) or download a [poster of
the The Single UNIX Specification history and timeline](https://unix.org/Posters/download/unix_posterA3.pdf).
