_(A weekly - or thereabouts - featured project/product that will make your life better)_

Take a look at all the Zoom meetings clogging up your day and keeping you from doing any actual work. I bet almost none
of them have an agenda. While it's tempting to blame the Covid-19 rush to distributed work for wasting our days in
haphazard and often pointless meetings, this same behavior has been its own plague since management learned how to click
'new meeting request.'

The co-creators of [Lean Coffee][lean-coffee], [Jim Benson][jim-benson] and [Jeremy Lightsmith][jeremy-lightsmith],
wanted to start a discussion group without a lot of overhead and pre planning. But, the meeting should still be useful
to the participants who are giving their time; _it should be enough to show up and want to learn and create_. They came
up with a meeting format that is easy to learn and easy to facilitate.

The [Lean Coffee][lean-coffee] page does a great job of explaining how to structure a lean coffee meeting and should be
enough to get you started with the idea of collaboratively creating an agenda and selecting which topics you're going to
tackle during the meeting. Go take a a look at how it works.

What about online meetings in the time of Covid-19? It's easy enough to use your video tool's whiteboard, a shared
google doc, or even a text file to mimic sticky notes or index cards. Here's an example of a Skype whiteboard that can
be drawn in less than a minute. Use a row of asterisks to indicate the number of votes for each topic and your agenda is
done and agreed upon.

Instead of inflicting another aimless, agenda-less meeting on your co-workers, try and see if this technique can bring
some small amount of organization, ownership, and purpose to _other epidemic_ of the modern workplace.
