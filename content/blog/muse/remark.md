_(A weekly featured project/product that will make your short life better.)_

You need to make a presentation. Don't use a bloated, [legacy presentation
tool](https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint). Use a modern, browser based slide show creation tool that supports
standards like html5 and css. One that lets you easily collaborate, share, and display with any civilized browser.

There are a bunch of [html based presentation tools](https://gist.github.com/vasilisvg/1611562), but
[Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is one of the most enjoyable to use.

You can click in the box and use left-right arrows to move through these slides which explain what Remark is and how to
get started using it. Or visit the presentation in all its [full sized glory](http://gnab.github.io/remark/#1).

The [GitHub project page](https://github.com/gnab/remark) documents how to get started. For inspiration, check out some
Remark based presentations:

- [Big Data in Time - Progress and Challenges from Oceanography](http://www.jmlilly.net/talks/bigdata16.html#1)
- [Busterjs-lightning-talk](http://torgeir.github.io/busterjs-lightning-talk/#1)

The [project page](https://github.com/gnab/remark) links to other sample presentations.

Go forth and create the illusion of understanding:
