_(A featured project/product that will make your short life better.)_

You need to make a presentation. Don't use a bloated, [legacy presentation
tool](https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint). Use a modern, browser based slide show creation tool that supports
standards like html5 and css. One that lets you easily collaborate, share, and display with any civilized browser.

There are a bunch of [html based presentation tools](https://gist.github.com/vasilisvg/1611562), but
[Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is one of the most enjoyable to use.

Visit the [Remark presentation](http://gnab.github.io/remark/#1) and left/right arrow through it to see what Remark is,
how it works, and how to make your own presentation.

The [GitHub project page](https://github.com/gnab/remark) provides complete documentation. For inspiration, check out
some Remark based presentations:

- [Big Data in Time - Progress and Challenges from Oceanography](http://www.jmlilly.net/talks/bigdata16.html#1)
- [Python 3 Awesome Features](https://www.asmeurer.com/python3-presentation/slides.html#1)
- [Groovy BDD](https://judoole.github.io/GroovyBDD/#1)

The [project page](https://github.com/gnab/remark) links to other sample presentations.

Go forth and create the illusion of understanding:
