[Seth Vincent](https://github.com/sethvincent) has created a [fantastic
project](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) to "learn JavaScript by adventuring around in the terminal."


Don't get [angry](http://pastebin.com/hsgbfQcR). Install [javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting),
fire up your [favorite editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and start your adventure.
